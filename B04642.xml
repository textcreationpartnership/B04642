            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head type="sub">For the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkins</hi> Knight His Majeſties Principal Secretary of State at <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Gave your Honour the laſt <hi>Friday</hi> the trouble of a few Lines, in which I told you, that I had buſineſs of Importance with the King and Councel; your anſwer was, <hi>That I muſt apply my ſelf to a Juſtice of Peace, or Courts of Juſtice:</hi> The buſineſs I had with the Council, is a Complaint againſt <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who in ſeveral Libels of his called the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and other Seditious Pamphlets, hath (as I humbly conceive,) Vilified and Ridicul'd the Evidence of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and Arraigned the Proceedings of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the ſaid <hi>Plot;</hi> And to give himſelf a reputation in this his Illegal courſe, he pretends in one or more of thoſe his ſaid <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators,</hi> that he hath Authority or leave from ſome of His Majeſties Miniſters for ſo doing; which I dare not believe. Your Honour knows, that His Majeſty was ſo ſenſible of the danger he was in, by reaſon of that Horrid Conſpiracy, that he did not only recommend the ſtrict examination thereof, to His Houſes of Parliament, but alſo was pleaſed to acquaint them, how unſafe he was till it was ſearched out to the bottom. Beſides this, three Faſts were Proclaimed, Appointed and kept, which the King himſelf ſtrictly kept, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all His Loving Subjects ſo to do; ſeveral have been Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſeveral Parliaments have Voted, <hi>That there was an Horrid, Helliſh Popiſh Plot;</hi> Now all theſe things conſidered, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have imagined that any private Perſons, could have been ſo bold with the Government, as to uſe ſuch Reflections upon their Proceedings, and call in queſtion the Veracity of the Teſtimony of that Evidence, which was juſtified by His Majeſties Council, and the Parliament, and the Courts of Juſtice; I thought I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have liv'd to have ſeen the day that the <hi>Plot</hi> ſhould be call'd in queſtion, which the King had own'd in his ſeveral Proclamations; But ſince it is ſo, I muſt pray your Pardon, if I cannot apply my ſelf for Redreſs in that way and method your Honour was pleaſed to order: For I humbly conceive that it is the Government that is abuſed, and therefore in Conſcience and Honour it is bound to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate its Proceedings from ſuch Aſperſions as are caſt upon them by the ſaid <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> and his Confederates; I would not uſe any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or way to injure the worſt of my Enemies, but that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil will take my hard uſage from the ſaid <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> into ſerious Conſideration, and cauſe the ſaid <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> to be Silenc'd, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to be made me. To that end, I have in this ſent a Petition to the King and Council, which I would have preſented if I might have had the liberty to appear at Court, in which I pray for Redreſs; I hope God will put it into your hearts to do me right. In the mean time, <hi>Sir,</hi> I am</p>

            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioner according to his Duty and Allegiance which he owes, and is always bound to pay to your Majeſty and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Eſtabliſh'd by Law, did in the month of <hi>September,</hi> in the year 1678. Diſcover a moſt Horrid, Helliſh <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> againſt your Majeſty and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> to the ſatisfaction of your Majeſty and the Privy Council, as appears by the ſeveral Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions iſſued out by your Majeſties Order, with the Advice of your moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy Council, which your Petitioner is, and will be ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce when thereunto commanded by your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>That your Majeſty was ſo highly ſenſible of the great danger your Perſon was in, and your Government, by reaſon of that Conſpiracy, that you were graciouſly pleaſed to proclaim ſeveral ſolemn Faſts and days of Humiliation, and did will and require your Loving Subjects to joyn in Hearty Prayers and Supplication with your Majeſty unto Almighty God for the Bleſſings of the Diſcovery, and for the farther Diſcovery thereof; and in ſeveral of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties moſt gracious Speeches to your Houſes of Parliament, hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to expreſs, <hi>How unſafe your Majeſty was till the ſaid Plot was ſearched to the bottom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſeveral of the Conſpirators in the <hi>Plot</hi> were Apprehended, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Indicted and Convicted, Attainted, and Executed upon your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners Evidence, together with the Evidence of others, the Attainders of which Conſpirators remain (as your Petitioner believes) upon Record.</p>
            <p>That four ſeveral Parliaments own'd the ſame Diſcovery, and paſs'd ſeveral Votes, wherein they did declare, <hi>That there was an Horrid</hi> Popiſh Plot <hi>for the Deſtruction of your Royal Perſon and your Government, and the Subverſion of the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>as by Law Eſtabliſhed</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange,</hi> whom your Petitioner hears is now a Juſtice of the Peace, (though turn'd out for ſeveral Miſdemeanors in the year 1680.) hath Defam'd and Arraign'd the Juſtice of the Nation, in Ridiculing the ſaid <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and the Diſcovery and the Diſcoverers thereof, in certain Scandalous and Seditious Pamphlets of his call'd the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and in ſeveral other Pamphlets.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> pretends in ſome of thoſe Seditious and Scandalous Pamphlets, <hi>That he is authoriz'd ſo to do by one or both your Secretaries</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the ſaid Scandalous and Seditious Pamphlet, appears to countenance <hi>Popery</hi> in your <hi>Proteſtant Government,</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> have been much encourag'd by the ſame, to Revile and Threaten your Petitioner; he the ſaid <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> pretending that he had Authority for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioner hath born the Scandalous Reflections and Aſperſions, upon the account of his Diſcovery of the ſaid <hi>Plot,</hi> from the ſaid <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> this four years with Patience; and had the Scandals only touch'd your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, I would not have complain'd to your Majeſty and this Honourable Board; But ſince the ſaid <hi>L'Estrange</hi> Scandalouſly vilifies the ſaid Diſcovery, and calls in queſtion the Juſtice of your Government, your Petitioner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it fit to apply himſelf to your Majeſty and this Board for Redreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Premiſſes conſider'd, your Petitioner humbly prays your Majeſty, and this Right Honourable Board, to Relieve your Petitioner, and his Evidence from the Seditious Calumnies of the ſaid</hi> Roger L'Eſtrange, <hi>and not ſuffer your Petitioner to be left, to be daily oppreſſed and deſtroy'd for thoſe Services, which your Majeſty, and Council, and Parliament, and Courts of Justice have own'd: And your Petitioner ſhall (as in duty bound) pray for your Majeſties Health, and long Life, and happy Reign,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
